It\u2019s probably easier just to wad it up and stick it in your pocket. The interior of this ball of web is an extradimensional space equivalent to a 10-foot cube. To place things into this space you must push it into the web, so it cannot hold liquids or gasses. You can only retrieve items you know are inside, making it excellent for smuggling. Retrieving items takes at least 2 actions (or more for larger objects) and things like loose coins tend to get lost inside it. No matter how full, the web never weighs more than a half pound.\n\nA creature attempting to divine the contents of the web via magic must first succeed on a DC 28 Arcana check which can only be attempted once between _long rests_ .\n\nAny creature placed into the extradimensional space is placed into stasis for up to a month, needing no food or water but still healing at a natural pace. Dead creatures in the web do not decay. If a living creature is not freed within a month, it is shunted from the web and appears beneath a large spider web 1d6 miles away in the real world.",

The broom\u2019s handle is said to have come from the first tree and the bristles stolen from a god, but its beginnings are far more humble\u2014just a simple mundane object that accrued its first enchantment by chance after years of exposure to countless rituals. Since then its attraction to magic has grown, and so too has its admiration for the arcane. The broom has been in the hands of countless spellcasters, many of them unlikely candidates to pursue magic, though it cannot remember their names. Only the feats of magic they achieved are of any worth to the broom.\n\n_**Sentience.**_ The broom is a sentient construct with Intelligence 19, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 17\\. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet. The broom communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Sylvan, and Undercommon. \n\n_**Personality.**_ The broom\u2019s purpose is to encourage the use of magic\u2014the more powerful the better\u2014regardless of any consequences. It is unconcerned with the goings on of mortals or anyone not engaged with magic, and it demands a certain amount of respect and appreciation for its service.\n\n**_Demands._** If you are unable to cast spells and attune to the broom, it relentlessly argues for you to pursue magical training and if none is achieved within a month it goes dormant in your hands (becoming a very durable stick). In addition, the broom is a repository of magic over the ages and it strongly encourages you to seek out monsters to harvest powerful reagents, explore cursed ruins in search of forbidden knowledge, and undertake precarious rituals.\n\nYou have a +3 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with the magic broom, and when the broom deals damage with a critical hit the target is _blinded_  until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Ancient Broom_, used by spellcasters since the dawn of time.\n\n**DC 18** The broom is able to animate itself and attack your enemies, it has the power to open locks and break shackles, and it enables you to move without leaving a trace of your passing.\n\n**DC 21** Many of those who have wielded the _Ancient Broom_ came from humble and unlikely backgrounds.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Ancient Broom_ has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment.\n\n**Magic**\n\nWhile you are attuned to the broom you gain an expertise die on checks made with Arcana, and while holding it you can innately cast __pass without trace_  (no _concentration_  required) and _nondetection_ at will.\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to knock the broom against a lock, door, lid, chains, shackles, or the like to open them. Once you have done so 3 times, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest. You can speak with the broom over the course of a _short rest_ , learning one ritual spell. The next time you use this feature, you forget the last spell learned from it.\n\n**Dancing Broom**\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to toss this broom into the air and cackle. When you do so, the broom begins to hover, flies up to 60 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The broom uses your _attack roll_  and ability score modifier to damage rolls, and unless a target is hidden or _invisible_  it has _advantage_  on its attack roll.\n\n While the broom hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the broom to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.\n\n The broom ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.",

The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.\n\n\u25c6 You can use a bonus action to toss this sword into the air and speak a different command word.

You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

It is single-minded in its purpose and highly motivated, but not unreasonable or averse to compromising its interests for a short time while in the pursuit of the greater good.\n\n_**Destroying the Sword.**_ The sword can never be permanently destroyed.

Invisibility is one thing but effectively hiding your home and your possessions can be harder. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to draw a large X on one object up to the size of a normal door. This has no effect on creatures, or objects worn by creatures. Creatures other than you that see the marked object roll a DC 10 Intelligence _saving throw_ . On a failed save, they do not notice the marked object as anything out of the ordinary from its surroundings (such as a blasphemous icon in a church, a barrel of gunpowder in a kitchen, or an unsheathed weapon resting against the wall of a bedroom going unnoticed). On a success, they can interact with the object normally. A creature that remains in the area and is consciously searching for the kind of object that you have marked receives a new saving throw at the end of each minute. A creature interacting with a marked object automatically reveals it to all creatures who observe the interaction. A charcoal mark lasts for 24 hours or until it is wiped away as an action. \n\nAlternatively, you can expend 2 charges to increase the DC to notice the object to 15\\. \n\nThe charcoal has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dusk.

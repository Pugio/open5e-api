If you don't perform a visible action, speak or be spoken to, or otherwise have attention drawn to you for at least 1 minute, creatures nearby have trouble remembering you are even in the room. Until you speak, perform a visible action, or have someone draw attention to you, creatures must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC equal to 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus) to notice you. Otherwise, they conduct themselves as though you aren't present until either attention is drawn to you or one of their actions would take them into or within 5 feet of the space you occupy.",

You can survive on 1 gallon of water in hot conditions (or 1/2 gallon in normal conditions) without being forced to make Constitution saving throws, and you are considered naturally adapted to hot climates. While in a desert, you can read the environment to predict natural weather patterns and temperatures for the next 24 hours, allowing you to cross dangerous terrain at the best times. The accuracy of your predictions is up to the GM, but they should be reliable unless affected by magic or unforeseeable events, such as distant earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.",
